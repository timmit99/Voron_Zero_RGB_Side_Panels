# Voron Zero RGB Side Panels
 ## Side panels for the Voron Zero printer with 16 WS2812 RGB LED's per side.
 
 The build below has some [3mm TAP Plastic black LED acrylic](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/black_led_sheet/668) installed INSIDE the frame extrusions to diffuse the LEDs. They are cut per the [DXF](/CAD/diffuserPanel.dxf) and the [PDF](/CAD/diffuserPanel.pdf) in the CAD folder.
